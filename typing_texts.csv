By the full moon hanging low in the west he knew what he might not have known otherwise: that it was near the hour of dawn. A light mist lay along the earth, partly veiling the lower features of the landscape, but above it the taller trees showed in well defined masses against a clear sky. Two or three farmhouses were visible through the haze, but in none of them, naturally, was a light. Nowhere, indeed, was any sign or suggestion of life except the barking of a distant dog, which, repeated with mechanical iteration, served rather to accentuate than dispel the loneliness of the scene."

Other tales may tell of witches, thieves, ghosts, cowboys, talking animals, or common villagers. Fables, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes are common types of folk stories. A fable is a short folktale that teaches a lesson about how people should behave. It usually has animal characters that speak and act like people. Fairy tales tell about magical beings such as fairies, elves, dragons, and trolls. Nursery rhymes tell entertaining stories in short, clever poems. People have told such stories to children for centuries."

This is why music has the platform it does today, as well as the adoration and allure. Instruments play a major role in the art of music. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument. Dating back over sixty thousand years, the flute is considered by most scholars to be the oldest musical instrument. Today there are many instruments used to produce melodies and sound. This is due in part, to the conversion of cultures that have influenced the design of instruments throughout history. So, what began on the shores of West Africa as a tree stump and a hand, is now known as drums throughout the world."

They belong to a large group of animals called whales. Dolphins are closely related to porpoises. Because dolphins and porpoises look so much alike, people often confuse the two. However, dolphins are usually larger and have longer, beaklike snouts. There are more than thirty five species, or types, of dolphin. They are divided into two groups, true dolphins and river dolphins. True dolphins live throughout the world in either salt water or fresh water. The most widespread species are the common dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin. River dolphins prefer fresh water."

If you do not have any skate parks in your hometown and planning to visit a park out of the town, make sure to check accommodation facilities beforehand. In addition to skateboard helmets and pads, you may also consider carrying an extra skate board in case one breaks. If you have not carried any protective gear along with you, you can ask the locals about the best skate shops around. The locals will also be able to help you with other attraction for skaters in the town."

However, when the comet gets close to the sun, the sun's heat causes it to shed gas and dust. A huge cloud of gas and dust called a coma builds up around the comet. The coma is sometimes larger than Earth. It makes the head of the comet look blurry. When a comet moves even closer to the sun it grows tails. This happens because the sun gives off energy and streams of particles. They push some of the coma's dust and gases out into long streams. Comet tails can be very long, as long as the distance from Earth to the sun. The coma and tails last only while the comet is fairly close to the sun."

They are layered accumulations of sediments, fragments of rocks, minerals, or animal or plant material. If a layer of sediment is buried beneath overlying rock, the layer becomes compacted and may form a layer of sedimentary rock. The sediment becomes cemented together by minerals and chemicals or is held together by electrical attraction. Sand and gravel deposits on beaches or in river bars look like the sandstone and conglomerate they may become. Compacted and dried mud flats harden into shale. Mud and shells settling on sea floors can cement into limestone. Sedimentary rocks are important sources of natural resources like coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores."

The owner will have to decide what sort of crossbow they purchase depending on what they will use it for and dedication to the use. People who are using their crossbows regularly, whether it be for practicing and competition or for serious hunting trips and big game hunting, will want to focus on higher end crossbows which are most often composed of carbon material. These crossbows are incredibly strong, lightweight, durable and provide the greatest power in function."

It is made of tiny water droplets and ice crystals. The water droplets and ice crystals zip and zoom around inside the cloud, banging into one another. This creates electric charges. Some charges are positive. They rise to the top of the storm cloud. Some are negative. They drop to the bottom of the cloud. Positive charges also build up near the ground. They build up on trees, rooftops, and even our van. The opposite charges attract each other. Negative charges from the cloud zigzag down toward the ground. The positive charges from the ground stream up into the air. When they meet, we see lightning."

There are several kinds of plants that can produce rubber. One kind, the India rubber plant, is a common houseplant. Most of the world's natural rubber, however, comes from the rubber tree. Rubber trees grow best in hot, humid climates with deep, well drained soil. People grow rubber trees mainly for their sap, called latex. After workers cut a slit in the bark, latex runs out and collects in a cup. This process is called tapping. The slit later closes up, so workers make a new one below it to collect more latex."

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything, then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves. Here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed, it was labelled 'orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty. She did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it."

They feed mainly on insects but will also eat frogs and other small animals, such as mice, that come along. Some large South American tarantulas make webs to catch small birds to eat. Many tarantulas, however, hunt rather than spin webs to catch food. These hunters use their sensitive hairs to detect vibrations from movements of prey. They strike the animal with their fangs and inject venom into it. Tarantulas then grind the prey into a ball, secrete digestive juices on it, and suck it up. Sometimes they wrap the prey in silk to be eaten later."

The body moves in a series of S shaped loops. Some large snakes, such as the boas, move in a straight line. They inch their body forward like a caterpillar does. Other snakes move by folding and unfolding like an accordion. Many desert snakes use a movement called sidewinding. They throw their body upward and sideways across the sand. Most snakes live alone for most of the year. Some kinds gather for mating or hibernation. Most snakes lay eggs, but others give birth to live young. The number of young varies from about three to more than fifty. At birth, baby snakes look like adult snakes. Snakes kept by people can live more than thirty years."

The opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster place to allow an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo bridge. A triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade. Through services started on 10 April 1908. They ran from Highbury station to Tower bridge and to Kennington gate. There was a procession of six cars that went south from the Holborn through to Kennington."

Buying gas is something we must do all too often, sometimes weekly to get us to work and other necessary destinations. It's not a bill that just comes around monthly such as utilities. It has become a constant strain on our cash flow. Perhaps the best lesson to be learned is to drive calmly, slow down and be patient. Drive as though there is a cup of hot coffee on your dashboard and you're doing your best not to spill it."

The subtleties of a video game are so hard to pick up on now, that when you do it is an incredibly satisfying feeling when you do perfect these techniques to improve your skill levels that much further. As it is for a gymnast when they finally land that front flip, it is great to be able to demonstrate your skill on a video game when you have finally overcome a certain challenge.

So scientists are searching for a clear explanation for why the squid are so similar but numerous. The public perception of giant squid is that they are rare. But the creatures seem rare only because they inhabit a different part of the planet than we do, Roper told Science News. Books like Moby Dick and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea have depicted these animals as sea monsters. And no wonder. Their eyes are larger than a human head. They use a parrot like beak to dismember their prey. And their tentacles seem to go on forever.

They use their arms and hands to push and pull objects, to fight and defend themselves, and to carry their young. Apes and monkeys also use their arms to swing on branches and to move around on the ground. Many other animals have two front limbs, but only primates have true arms. The two front limbs of other animals are known as legs, flippers, or wings. Both sea stars, or starfish, and octopuses have limbs that people sometimes call arms. But these arms have no bones or joints. Sea star arms are also called rays, and octopus arms are also called tentacles."

Like anything worth accomplishing, pencil drawing gives great satisfaction as you spend the time to practice. Set aside some time every day to work on a certain technique. Only 15 or 20 minutes can move you along and you will find it relaxing and more fulfilling than staring at the television.

It's best to find 3 to 5 locations close to, or on the way to where you live or work. This approach gives you options and also allows you to quickly take advantage of ever changing light and weather conditions. Choose locations that have a variety of tree species. The contrasting colors combined with the proper light can provide a gorgeous setting. The times just after sunrise and early evening generally work best. While you are scouting for, or shooting at you locations don't forget to look for small objects."

Spiral galaxies look like pinwheels. They have a central disk and two or more curved arms winding outward. The disk consists mainly of older stars, while the arms have younger stars. The arms contain much dust and gas, from which new stars can form. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. An elliptical galaxy may be shaped like a round ball or may be more stretched out, like an American football. It has more stars near its center and fewer stars in its outer regions. Elliptical galaxies vary widely in size. Small elliptical galaxies are the most common kind of galaxy in the universe."

The storm probably died out on October 23. The storm was unusual because it was first thought to be two different hurricanes. This is because of the loop it made in the Gulf of Mexico. One paper reported that the first hurricane died in the central Gulf of Mexico; the second hurricane formed and hit Florida. The storm's path was debated, and it was later found to be a single cyclone. On October 9, a type of storm called a Tropical Depression began in the southern Caribbean Sea. It was north of Panama."

You do this by reading a portion of their favorite story, and then asking them questions which will get them involved in the story. As your child begins to build their ability to answer more questions about the portion of text in question, read longer portions of the book before stopping. Gradually increase the amount you read before asking questions about the story, until you're able to read the entire book and your child can still recall the parts of the story which correlate to the questions you ask."

In their search for answers, some will pay a visit to their local museum. They are not trying to take their minds off the outbreak. Instead, they come to sift through the museum's historic collections, looking for clues that might help them save lives. For instance there was an outbreak of hantavirus in New Mexico and nearby states. The sometimes deadly disease causes flu like symptoms and difficulty breathing. At the time, no one knew the source of the outbreak. Some people even suspected terrorists might have released the germs as a biological weapon."

The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships but did not end the evolution of design. Both the allies and the axis powers deployed battleships of old construction and new during World War II. The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during the period of their prominence. In spite of the immense resources spent on battleships, there were few pitched battleship clashes."

Carbon dioxide becomes a solid at a very low temperature, so dry ice is very cold. But unlike ice made from water, dry ice does not melt. Instead, it goes straight from a solid to a gas. Dry ice may be used when shipping meat, ice cream, or other products that need to be kept cold. Carbon dioxide is useful in baking as well. Yeast, baking powder, and baking soda all release carbon dioxide gas when they are mixed into batter or dough. The gas forms bubbles, which cause the batter or dough to rise, or expand. Carbon dioxide also is added to drinks like soda pop to make them bubbly. These fizzy drinks are called carbonated beverages."

A well trained pet will be protective and loyal to your family. These dogs are very intelligent though they may be stubborn. They are very much capable of obeying and learning if you work with them consistently. The breed loves to please the owners so they will definitely do everything they can to please you and follow your commands once it has been trained. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources available today on training this breed and you may even ask for suggestions and guidance from the breeder where you purchase the puppy from.

Here are some foods that can cause stress when you eat too much of them. Caffeine is well known as a stimulant. When you're trying to relax, having a caffeine boost isn't the answer to your problem. You don't have to eradicate it forever, but try to limit your intake of caffeine if you're feeling the effects of stress in your life. Candy is another food item that has potential for causing a good amount of stress."

Hubble has seen the birth and death of stars. It has seen galaxies that are billions of light years away. Hubble has also seen comet pieces crash into the atmosphere above Jupiter. Hubble is named after the astronomer Edwin P. Hubble. He made important discoveries in the early 1900s. He found many galaxies in the universe. His work also led to the idea that the universe was getting bigger, as if from a big explosion. Scientists call this explosion the big bang. The explosion would have happened billions of years ago."

Instead they have roots that spread out near the surface of the soil. This is important to their survival. These roots absorb water from a wide area during the few times it rains. Cacti are known for their pointy spines. These grow in different patterns on the plant's surface. Some cacti also have flowers and branches. Most do not have leaves.

Now at least, neuroscientists who study the brain might have found a clue about why it is so difficult to force that creative spark. Researchers recently set out to explore the origins of creativity in the brain and came up with surprising findings.

As blood travels outward, the arteries become smaller and smaller until eventually the blood enters into what are known as capillaries. Capillaries are so tiny that blood usually can only get through one cell at a time. It is within the capillaries that oxygen is taken in by the cells, and waste, such as carbon dioxide, is released into the blood.

For fresh foods, the decay process may be slowed down by refrigeration or checked by freezing. When frozen food is thawed, however, the bacteria become active again. Many kinds of bacteria can be killed by heat. Because few species grow in foods that are acidic, dried, salted, or very sweet, it is easier to process foods with these qualities. For example, canning acidic foods such as tomatoes is less complicated than processing green beans. The amount of heat required to can non acidic foods successfully is very high because of the need to destroy thermophilic bacteria and their spores."

Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief compared to the much larger planets, and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.

This kind of detailed information helps make your family tree website more than just a static page of dates and names. It makes it an interesting gathering place for people who could possibly be your kinfolk. Fourth on your list of must have ingredients for a family tree website is information you're still seeking. What gaps are left in your research that you're hoping someone else can fulfill? Do you need contact information or to flesh out the dates and times events took place in your family's history? Broadcasting it on a family tree website can help others know what they need to do to pitch in.

If you do, everything looks good and you'll find yourself straying from the list. You might want to have a small snack before you shop to curb any ravenous appetite. Compare the unit price and buy a larger size if it's less per ounce or per pound. You can always divide it up in smaller packages when you get home. Higher priced items are usually placed at eye level so look up or down for lower priced foods. More expensive items are also usually on the high traffic aisles so wander off the beaten path. Those tiny one person servings of cereal cost more so buy the larger boxes. Hot cereals are usually less expensive per serving than the ready to eat cereal."

But too much data can slow the flow. That's why engineers have been developing clever ways to deliver big data at fast speeds. And a new type of fiber optic cable may do just that. Fiber optic cables contain bundles of thin, flexible glass fibers that transmit light. Nothing travels faster than light. So companies that offer customers lightning fast access to the Internet use these cables to move data. Light has its limits, however. Like rush hour on a crowded highway, too much data in a cramped cable leads to congestion."

Cells divide throughout a tiny plant's system when it is still inside its seed. As soon as the developing plant forms a root tip, shoot tip, and tiny leaves, cell division is limited to certain areas of the plant. One area is at the root, where new cells cause roots to grow deeper into the soil. Another area where cells divide is near the shoot tip. New cells at the shoot tip allow for the growth of stems and leaves. New cells at these locations can continue to divide."

In the last twenty years, astronomers have identified about two thousand new worlds using a telescope in space. These planets orbit stars that lie tens or even hundreds of light years from Earth. These discoveries are important, but no single planet is likely to be much of a big deal. The new planet is a very different story. It does not circle a distant star. Instead, it is part of our own solar system, a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now. Evidently not. A new study has found strong evidence of a very large undiscovered planet. They say the new planet is orbiting in the solar system's outer darkness beyond Pluto."

Insects move their legs and wings with muscles hidden under their exoskeleton, or hard covering. Fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals move with the help of muscles connected to their skeleton. All the muscles in an animal's body make up its muscular system. There are three types of muscle. Muscle connected to a skeleton is called skeletal muscle. Animals with backbones, including humans, also have two other types of muscle: cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle makes blood flow. Smooth muscle helps to digest food."

A lot of people continue to place glass and aluminum items in their normal garbage but it's not hard to locate a trash service that offers glass and aluminum recycling choices. It merely takes a few minutes to wash off the cans and bottles before placing them into the recycle bin. Newspapers are another item that overburden our landfills.

It may seem like it just comes naturally, and to an extent it does. However, there are things you can do to prepare your baby to walk. Babies don't just wake up one day and start walking. There's a natural progression from rolling over, to sitting up, to crawling, to pulling up to walking. Teaching your baby to walk easily depends on her mastering those first steps. When your baby starts to become mobile, it's important to make sure that your home is a safe environment. Toys that allow your baby to push or pull are excellent to teach your baby to walk. You can also play by kicking and throwing balls. These little activities will promote eye hand coordination and balance."

People of ancient times based their calendars on the most obvious regular events they knew the changing positions of the sun, moon, and stars. These calendars helped them figure out when to plant and harvest their crops. Over time different groups of people developed other calendars based on their own needs and beliefs. Several units of time are common to almost all calendars. The day is the most basic unit. The day measures the cycle of daytime and nighttime. It is now known to be the length of time the Earth takes to spin once on its axis. A group of seven days is called a week. Unlike the day, the week is not based on any astronomical event."

In 1929, it was then decided that the headroom of the tunnel would be increased to 16 feet 6 inches. This would be done by raising the roof or deepening the tunnel as appropriate. Work started on 11 September 1929. The work resulted in the replacement of the cast iron tubes with a new steel girder supported roof. The sewer was also diverted.

However, in the century since this vision was proposed, we have learned things about the universe and ourselves. The things suggest moving out into space may not be our future after all. A big problem is the size of the universe. Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars.

Brass doorknobs, faucets, and towel racks are found in many homes. Brass is also used to make such musical instruments as trombones, trumpets, French horns, and tubas. Brass is made by heating copper to a very high temperature. Then workers add small amounts of heated zinc to the copper. The zinc melts into the copper and forms brass. Workers may also add small amounts of other metals to make the brass stronger."

Use the highest gear possible and overdrive gears if you have them. The faster an engine is turning, the more gas you're using. Pay attention to your tachometer. Plus, a slower turning engine means less friction and engine wear. Avoid excessive idling. Idling gets zero miles per gallon. It doesn't get much worse than that.

Materials that cause a cough come from various places. Smoke, dust, chemicals, and pollution in the air all can trigger a cough. Illnesses such as colds, influenza, and pneumonia also can cause a cough. These illnesses cause parts of the respiratory system to make more of a thick, sticky fluid called mucus. The mucus builds up and makes it harder to breathe. Coughing brings the mucus up and out of the mouth. Mucus may also drip down the back of the throat from the nose."

So, the new rule was, a century year, 1600, 1700, etc. would only be a leap year if it was evenly divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, but 2100 will not be. The Egyptians were the first people to think of adding a leap day to the calendar every four years. Later, the Romans copied the idea. Other nations have different calendars and different methods of keeping the calendar in line with the solar year. A day, or in some cases a month, gets added every few years, according to the organization of the particular calendar. The Chinese, for example, add a month about every three years."

Water helps animals take in nutrients and get rid of waste. It helps them keep cool on hot days. If water is hard to find, animals must conserve water. A camel can go without drinking water for a long time, sometimes as long as six months. It also saves water by not sweating. A camel can change its body temperature during the hottest part of the day. This keeps it from overheating. Because it does not need to sweat to cool itself down, it saves water. Camels are not the only animals that have unique waterways. The kangaroo rat seldom drinks water. Instead, it gets water from the plants it eats."

About 1000 years ago, the ancestors of today's Timbisha Shoshone people came to the valley. Over time, the climate changed. Temperatures rose. Less rain fell. The lake dried up.

One warning sign of a bad transmission is when your vehicle begins to leak transmission fluid. If you park on a white surface, such as a concrete driveway or in a garage, you will be able to tell if you have such fluid leakage. If you notice any pinkish fluid leaking out, then you will know that it is from the transmission. Also any very dark or burned looking fluid is another sign that the transmission may be having a problem since optimal color should be a dark or cherry red. Any fluids leaking from your vehicle are cause for concern and warrant taking your vehicle to get transmission repair at as soon as possible."

This condition is called nearsightedness. Similarly, farsighted people have trouble seeing nearby objects. Their eyeballs are too short. Glasses, contact lenses, or surgery can correct these problems. Blindness happens when the eye's lens becomes cloudy or when the retina is damaged. Vertebrates, or animals with a backbone, each have two eyes similar to human eyes. But there are differences, which depend on the animal's habitat and behavior. For example, the pupils of animals active at night are often shaped like slits. This allows the pupils to close almost completely to protect the eyes from bright light."

The polar bear's coat is perfectly adapted to its arctic environment. Along with a thick layer of body fat, the water repellent coat insulates the bear from cold air and water. It also serves as camouflage. Polar bears are excellent swimmers and can sustain a pace of 10 kph. Adult males can measure up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 1500 lbs. They spend much of their time at or near the edge of the pack ice. This is where they are most likely to find food. As the southern edge of the ice cap melts in summer, some bears will follow the retreating ice north while others head to land. When the ice returns in the fall, the bears can resume life on the sea ice."

Most sea slugs digest the chloroplasts right away. However, some species store them for weeks to months in large transparent digestive glands, turning the animals bright green. For many years, scientists have thought the slugs store chloroplasts in order to become solar powered combinations of animal and plant. The theory made a lot of sense."

For example, when a deep cut on human skin closes with new skin growth, it may leave a scar. Similarly, a tree trunk that is burned will produce a new covering, though the bark may be scarred.

Another important aspect of training American bulldogs is socializing them. These dogs will need to be socialized from an early age so that they are not aggressive or reserved around strangers.

All gum bases are made of three kinds of ingredients which give gum its special properties, resin is the main part you chew, wax softens the gum and elastomer adds flexibility. Companies that manufacture gum have chemists working in laboratories to make gum better. One idea is to trap the sweetener and flavoring in the gum so that the flavor gets released more slowly.

In one version a plaster mold is made around a model. When the mold has hardened, it is split apart and taken off the model. The mold is then put back together, with a hollow space where the model was. A mixture of plaster and water is poured into the mold and left to dry.

They grab some of the sugar or nutrients as they come by and it helps them grow. Sugary soft drinks and chocolate bars are among their favorite treats! If you forget to brush your teeth for a day or two, a thick, slippery layer will build up on your teeth. If you scrape it off with your fingernail, it will appear as a whitish goop. This is what dentists call plaque. One tiny dab may contain millions or even billions of bacteria."

Most of these sweet spot finders take about 20 seconds to determine the sweet spot of a ball. And once it's marked, you can simply tee up with the dotted area ready for impact with your swing. Every ball has its own unique measurements, and although they're invisible to the naked eye, they're there, and they can mean the difference between a hole in one on a par 3 and a triple bogey if you're unsure of how to handle a ball with imperfections."

Fortunately, the former is absolutely not true at all, the latter, on the other hand, is mostly correct. While it's certainly true that spiders have blue liquid in their veins, the reality is a bit more grounded than is sometimes depicted, with the fluid a much more reserved shade of blueish green. Also, thanks to fact that spiders are, generally, so tiny and contain very little liquid, you're not going to see too much of this after smashing one.

One monkey could press a yellow or green button while the other watched. If the first monkey pressed the right button, the team gave both animals a treat. Every couple of rounds, the two monkeys switched roles. Meanwhile, the scientists monitored individual cells in the animals brains. When the first monkey flubbed the game by pressing the wrong button, a group of cells in the medial frontal cortex of the second monkey's brain fired. But if the second monkey also made the wrong choice during its turn, some of the cells in that group didn't respond. Those unresponsive cells reacted specifically to mistakes made by others, not to the monkey's own mistakes."

Food enters the small intestine after it leaves the stomach. At this time the food is in the form of a thick liquid. Digestive juices from other organs, including the pancreas and the liver, enter the small intestine. They work with juices from the small intestine to break down the food into simple chemical substances. These substances then pass into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine.

A city's power plant produces a powerful electric current and sends it through wires. The electricity used for lighting, heating, and running appliances is made by machines called generators. Generators cause a current to flow by moving a magnet past a coil of wire, which pushes electrons through the wires of the coil. Wires carrying the current travel to houses and other buildings. More wires connect to the power outlets in rooms. When a person plugs in an iron or another electric device, the current travels into the device. The current then makes the device work. A chemical reaction in a battery can also produce an electric current."

For example, people see the Sun because it gives off its own light. But people see the moon only because it reflects light from the sun. When only the surface of an object can be seen, the object is said to be opaque. Opaque objects do not let light pass through them. Instead they reflect and absorb light. As a result, they are not see-through. For example, a mirror is an opaque object that reflects almost all of the light that hits it. Most other opaque objects reflect and absorb some light.

Wind has the ability to pick up and transport small amounts of dust and rocks. Over time, the wind can completely change what a particular location looks like.

Initially, the driving force was the discovery of new trade routes between Europe and the Far East. After such routes had been established and the main geographical features of the earth had been broadly mapped, the lure for mercantile adventurers was the great fertile continent of Terra Australis which, according to myth, lay hidden in the south. Belief in the existence of this supposed land of plenty persisted well into the 18th century; explorers were reluctant to accept the truth that slowly emerged, of a cold, harsh environment in the lands of the Southern Ocean."

Humans have long wondered what life on another planet might be like. People have also wondered how different kinds of technology might affect life on Earth. Made up stories that address such questions are called science fiction. These stories may discuss ideas about scientific facts or real technology. But they also involve a lot of imagination. For example, a story might describe people meeting with space aliens for the first time. Another story might imagine what would happen if robots or computers could think and feel like humans. Many science fiction stories present different possible futures for human society."

For a long time they wanted to join the two together. This would allow them to send trams from the north side to the central repair depot in Charlton in south east London for overhauls. In 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the holborn area and rebuild them. This gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway. In 1902, the council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground. The subway went from Theobalds Road in the north to the embankment underneath Waterloo bridge to the south. From there a line that was not underground would continue over Waterloo bridge."

The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net.

Native American tribes are challenging attempts by federal wildlife officials to end legal protections for the bears, which roam the wilderness in and around Yellowstone National Park. The tribes are concerned hunters will kill the bears, which they believe are sacred. The tribes opposition is the latest chapter in the history of these huge, ferocious animals.

Fog is like a cloud, but it is near the ground, not high in the sky. Thick fog makes it difficult to see the surrounding landscape. Fog forms from water vapor, which is water in the form of a gas. Water vapor in the air condenses, or turns back into liquid, when the air cools. Fog appears when this liquid gathers around bits of dust in the air. A gentle wind helps fog to form and to stay in the air. If the water vapor condenses on the ground instead, it is called dew. Fog is very common in valleys and near bodies of water. It usually forms at night, when the air cools down. As the air warms in the morning, the fog evaporates, or dries up."

They also learned that it was the oldest dome headed dinosaur specimen found in North America and possibly the world. The skull was also special because it belonged to a small dinosaur. It weighed around 40 kilograms and was about as tall as a large dog. Dr. Evans said paleontologists don't find many fossils from smaller dinosaurs. This may mean that there were fewer small dinosaurs than large ones. Or it may be because small dinosaur skeletons were destroyed by weather or other animals before they could become fossils. This skull likely survived because of the thickness of the hard bone on top.

Language can be used in several ways to tell a story, marvel at the wonders of nature, explain the universe, give advice, or ponder the mysteries of life and death. Among these ways are the novel, short story, essay, and dramatic tragedy and comedy. All of these can be defined rather easily, and each has qualities that separate it from the rest.

Recent studies in human brain structure, however, have shown something different. They indicate that over the course of human development the cerebellum established connections with many different brain regions. The findings may show that the different brain regions are interconnected. They may demonstrate the need to develop new neurological models of higher cognition, including creativity."

These are pores. Hairs grow from the dermis up and out of each pore. Organs called glands sit near the bottom of each hair. Some of these glands produce sweat to help cool the skin. Others pump an oily substance up to the outer surface of the skin which is important for skin health. It forms a protective barrier that holds in moisture and locks out many disease causing microbes. A clogged pore that hasn't closed up completely can form a tiny pimple called a blackhead. A whitehead happens when the pore seals up and swells with inflammation. When this happens, some people may even develop hard lumps underneath, called nodules."

The sun sends out a stream of electrically charged particles called the solar wind. The solar wind travels from the sun toward the Earth at great speed. The Earth is a huge magnet surrounded by a magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field forces the charged particles in the solar wind toward the planet's northern and southern polar regions. The particles move downward through the Earth's upper atmosphere. As they do, they crash into atoms and molecules of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. These collisions cause the atoms and molecules to give off light. This light is an aurora. An aurora's colors are determined by the different gases that give off the light."

Yet few foods are discarded so frequently. In the last few years as much as half of all seafood was wasted. Families and food businesses buy fresh and frozen fish. Sometimes, they don't eat it or sell it before it goes bad. Several billion pounds of seafood are wasted each year.

There are thousands of species of dung beetles in the scarab beetle family. Some other species of beetle are also called dung beetles, but they do not form dung balls. Instead, they dig burrows underneath piles of manure. A dung beetle uses its head and antennae to roll dung into a ball. It then buries itself in the ball and feeds on the dung. Different species make different sizes of balls. Some giant dung beetles form dung balls that are four inches across."

They are the largest of the 17 species, and they spend their entire lives on Antarctic ice and in its waters. They survive by relying on a number of clever adaptations. Emperors clump together in huge, huddled masses. They take turns moving to the inside of the group, where they're protected from the icy cold temperatures and wind. These flightless birds breed in the winter. After a courtship of several weeks, a female emperor penguin lays one single egg then leaves. Female emperors take off toward the open sea to feed, traveling up to 50 miles across the frozen surface."

A caterpillar spins its cocoon with threads of sticky fluid that flow from an opening in the lower lip. The fluid hardens in the air to form the covering. Some caterpillars form a bag of silk that encloses them completely. Others roll up a leaf and fasten the edges with the silk."

Around this time babies make the delightful discovery that one hand can hold, pull, and play with the other. Once babies have started fiddling with their own hands, they soon reach the important stage of finding those hands by eye as well as by touch. Having first noticed their own two hands playing together, babies will spend minutes at a time, for weeks on end, watching and experimenting with them."

First, an object vibrates. A vibrating object makes tiny, very fast back and forth movements. For example, when a musician strums guitar strings, they vibrate. The vibration moves the surrounding air and produces waves of sound. Second, the sound waves pass into a medium. A medium is any substance through which the waves can travel. Sound waves may travel through many mediums. These include air, water, and solid objects. Sound waves pass through mediums in all directions. Third, some kind of receiver, such as the ear of a person, picks up the sound waves. The ear changes the sound waves into signals that travel to the brain. The brain understands these signals as sound."

It has widely different landscapes, a family of wildly spinning moons and volcano like mountains that spew ice instead of rock. Those surprises are among the many that have been uncovered. The Pluto mission is offering scientists rich lessons. Even though Pluto is part of the solar system, it's so far away that scientists had known little about what it might be like. One surprising feature is a gigantic heart shaped basin that has begun charming observers on Earth. The basin is over five hundred miles wide and two miles deep. Researchers believe it might have been caused by an impact with some huge space rock more than 4 billion years ago."

Like waves moving across a pool of water, light waves have peaks and valleys. The distance between two of these peaks is called a wavelength. Sunlight contains light waves with long, medium, and short wavelengths. The color of light depends on its wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength. Violet light has the shortest wavelength. Orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo have wavelengths in between those of red and violet. When light waves of all the colors travel together, the light looks white."

This means that they do not push or pull on each other at all electrically. However, sometimes electrons can build up in an object. Two such objects can push or pull on each other because they are no longer neutral. This push or pull from extra electrons is called static electricity. Static electricity can cause interesting effects, like sparks or lightning bolts, when it is released. Sometimes the extra electrons build up by rubbing one object against another. For example, when one rubs a balloon against one's hair, electrons move from the balloon to the hair."

It appears as a multicolored arc whose ends seem to touch the Earth. Rainbows are seen only when the observer is between the sun and the water drops, so rainbows appear in the part of the sky opposite the sun. The center of the rainbow's arc passes through the vertical plane defined by the light source and the observer's eye. Rainbows are most commonly seen when the sun's rays strike raindrops falling from distant rain clouds. Generally, this is only in the early morning or late afternoon."

He peeked into their kitchen. He looked through their glass door. One evening the cub stood alone in the rain. It was looking for a way into the family's home. They live just across the mouth of the Columbia River from Astoria. The family fed the cub apple slices. The mother bear did not come back for two nights. So they called the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. A wildlife official got the cub into a bear trap. The official used apple slices to help catch the bear. The cub is healthy so it will be taken to a special care center. Other bear cubs are being raised there too. The hope is that he will be brought back to the wild one day.

Color is what needs to stand out in your fall photos, so you should consider using the vibrant mode setting on your camera if it's available. If your camera is not equipped with this setting you can increase saturation to achieve the same effect. You can also tweak your photos after the fact with a photo editing program. Programs such as adobe photoshop elements and corel paintshop photo pro allow you to adjust exposure, saturation, and contrast to improve the overall look of your photos.

No two gamma ray burst light curves are identical, with large variation observed in almost every property: the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes, there can be a single peak or several individual subpulses, and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading. Some bursts are preceded by a precursor event, a weak burst that is then followed, after seconds to minutes of no emission at all, by the much more intense true bursting episode.

As that happens, the tree line that marks where forests stop and the treeless tundra starts has been shifting northward. Trees growing along the tree line must protect themselves from the cold wind. To do this, plants tend to grow horizontal limbs low to the ground. The energy it takes for trees to grow this way means they don't have enough leftover to make seeds. But as Earth's climate has been warming, trees no longer have to just grow horizontally. Many can instead grow up, toward the sky. This takes less energy.

As technology has improved, so have the quality and accuracy of maps. Ancient maps were usually drawn by explorers. It was impossible at that time for anyone to leave the earth and look down at the huge continents below. All they could do was walk around the different land formations, and then do their best to draw what they thought the land probably looked like. In the modern world, our ability to view and map the earth is much improved. However, even today it is impossible to draw a flat map that is 100% accurate. This is due to the impossibility of recreating the surface of a round planet on a flat map."

The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the fleet sewer. They then rose slightly to enter Holborn tramway station. From here up to Aldwych tramway station the subway was built with a steel roof. Because it was not planned to run a public service south of here at first, the tracks leading towards the strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits. The first public tram through the subway ran on 24 February 1906. It ran from the Angel, Islington to Aldwych."

The fuel burns when it is mixed with oxygen gas and ignited, or set on fire. As the fuel burns, it gives off hot gas that shoots out from an opening at the back of the chamber. The force of the gas moving backward pushes the rocket forward. This action is called jet propulsion. The engines of a jet airplane also use jet propulsion. But unlike a jet engine, rockets carry their own oxygen supply. This makes rockets valuable in outer space, where there is no oxygen. Rocket fuel can be liquid or solid.

New cells in these tissues cause the fibers that carry water and sugar throughout the plant to grow. The new cells also help a plant's thick outer covering to grow.

The ponies live together in small groups called bands. Some bands may have as few as two ponies. Others may have a dozen. In most bands there are usually several mares, or adult females, some foals, and one adult male pony. The adult male pony is called a stallion. It is his job to protect the band.

On many lobsters the first pair has large claws. One of the claws grows larger than the other. It is used for crushing food. The smaller claw is sharp and can grab and tear prey. A lobster can grow a new leg or claw if it loses one. In addition to the ten legs, a lobster has several structures on the underside of the body that help it to move. These swimming legs are called swimmerets. A lobster's eyes are on movable stalks that extend from the head. Some deep sea lobsters are blind. Lobsters also have two pairs of antennae. They are covered with sensors, which help the lobster find food, enemies, and mates."

A good plaything stimulates children to do things for themselves. They soon become bored with a toy that can do only one thing. Play equipment should encourage children to explore and to create, or it should offer them opportunities for dramatic play. Fairly large toys are important for young children because their muscle coordination has not developed well enough for them to handle small things easily."

In addition to providing strength and protecting your body, your bones also are where blood is created. Your blood is alive. It is made up of millions and millions of tiny blood cells. These cells only live for a few months. This means that your blood supply must constantly be regenerated. If you could see into the very center of your bones you would find a soft spongy material called bone marrow. This marrow is where new baby blood cells are being created.

It is now the winds that control flight direction. But the balloonist can change altitude by throwing ballast overboard or by releasing gas. So fine is the balance between gas and weight that a second's escape of gas or a pound of sand thrown overboard can cause a sharp change in altitude. As the balloon rises, the lesser pressure of the upper air permits the gas to expand. The balloon tends to go higher and higher. If the expanding bag threatens to burst, the balloonist releases gas. To come down, the balloonist lets gas escape gradually until the balloon becomes somewhat heavier than air."

The fuel burns when it is mixed with oxygen gas and ignited, or set on fire. As the fuel burns, it gives off hot gas that shoots out from an opening at the back of the chamber. The force of the gas moving backward pushes the rocket forward. This action is called jet propulsion. The engines of a jet airplane also use jet propulsion. But unlike a jet engine, rockets carry their own oxygen supply. This makes rockets valuable in outer space, where there is no oxygen. Rocket fuel can be liquid or solid. The U.S. space shuttle uses both liquid and solid fuel rockets. Two solid fuel booster rockets launch the shuttle into space. Three liquid-fuel rocket engines allow it to move in and out of orbit."

It can also be ground into very small pieces and then mixed with glue and shaped to make various products. Cork is useful as a stopper for bottles because liquids cannot pass through it. Cork is also a natural insulating material. It can be used to keep a house warm or to absorb sound. Because cork floats, it is used to make life preservers and buoys.

Yin and yang mean literally the dark side and the sunny side of a hill. In Chinese they represent the opposites of which the world is thought to be composed, dark and light, female and male, earth and heaven, death and birth, matter and spirit. This is called a system of dualism, or two sidedness. The two forces yin and yang are believed to be complementary and contrasting principles. Each makes up for what the other lacks, and the wholeness of the world would be incomplete if there were a deficiency of either."

Iron is used to make steel. In turn, steel is used to make buildings, bridges, railroad tracks, vehicles of all kinds, and countless other products. Iron is the second most common metal in Earth's crust. Of the metals in the crust, only aluminum is more common. Iron is also the fourth most common element in the crust. Iron in its pure form is a heavy, silvery, magnetic metal. But iron is almost never found in its pure form in nature. Instead, it is found in the form of iron ores. Ores are minerals with mixtures of different elements. The main iron ores are made up of iron linked to oxygen or to oxygen and carbon."

One of the best early reading strategies you can practice with your child is to read with them and as you repeat the words, follow along with your finger. When children first begin taking an interest in reading, they have little idea that those funny looking squiggles on the page actually mean something. By following along as you read, perhaps even pausing to sound out a word or two on the way, you'll help your child to better grasp the concept of the fact that those marks on the page actually represent what is being read."

But when the reward is big enough a new smartphone perhaps it's easier to wait. There's a trade off between the size of the reward and the amount of time we are willing to wait for it. The same is true for other animals. Animals won't wait for money, of course, but they will wait for other things, such as food. For years, psychologists studied pigeons and rats to try to understand how long they would wait for food. Both species are commonly used in lab research. And both, scientists find, are impulsive. They are willing to wait only a few seconds for a bigger meal."

They were also the largest land animals that ever lived. Sauropods were plant eaters that walked on four legs. Sauropods had a very small head and brain when compared to their huge body. But they had a long neck, which let them reach leaves on even the tallest trees. They had thick, strong legs, like those of an elephant. Many sauropods probably could stand up on their back legs to reach even higher into the trees. They used their long, muscular tail to balance themselves when standing. Some sauropods also might have used the tail as a whip like weapon. Most, if not all, dinosaurs laid eggs. Some dinosaurs built large nests to keep their babies together. Young dinosaurs grew very fast. Many reached full size in seven or eight years."

Long before refrigerators were invented, people would freeze food in snow and ice or cool food in streams and caves. Underground cellars beneath houses were cool, dry places where people stored food. Ice houses were insulated buildings containing ice. They were built outside of people's homes to store food. People's kitchens also had ice boxes, which were insulated boxes filled with ice for storing food. Ice was delivered to homes to fill the ice houses or iceboxes. Mechanical refrigeration and freezing developed in the eighteen hundreds. This allowed for perishable foods to be kept longer and shipped to other areas."

Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma ray bursts may convert as much as half or more of the explosion energy into gamma rays."

Wind forms sand dunes and changes their shape. It also blows soil off dry farmland. As wind throws sand and soil at rock, the shape of the rock slowly changes. The huge masses of ice called glaciers also cause erosion. Glaciers scrape away parts of the rocks and the earth below as they creep down mountain valleys. They carry this material along with them. Glaciers can even move boulders as big as houses. When the glaciers melt, the moved rocks and earth stay behind. A landslide shows how gravity helps erosion. Wind and rain can weaken the sides of mountains and hills. Gravity then causes soil, mud, and rocks to tumble down."

People seldom see these mysterious creatures. But scientists just got to know the animals much better. In a study published in March, researchers clear up a long-standing mystery about how closely these animals are related. They find the colossal creatures belong to a single global species. A species is a group of organisms that are similar enough to breed with each other. Until now, scientists had thought that giant squid belonged to three different species. One species lived in the North Atlantic ocean, another in southern oceans and a third in waters near Japan."

The ponies have been roaming free on the island for hundreds of years. They are feral animals. This means that their ancestors once were tame. No one knows exactly how the ponies got to the island. Some people believe that long ago the first ponies were being transported by ship from Spain. They think the ship wrecked near the island in a storm, and the ponies swam ashore.

According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other due to the release of energy via gravitational radiation until the neutron stars suddenly rip each other apart due to tidal forces and collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion induced collapse of a neutron star, or the evaporation of primordial black holes."

While much of the construction in these sites conforms to common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug house, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built right up against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could and no areas were considered off limits to construction."

Originally the term ore was applied only to metallic minerals, but the term now includes non metallic substances that have been deposited in rock after its formation. All metals come from ore deposits found in the Earth's crust. Raw ores bear little resemblance to familiar metals such as chromium or nickel. In most cases, the metals in the ores are not in the free, or pure, state. They are in chemical combination with other elements.

The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea. Due to a low bridge this service could only be operated with single deck vehicles. Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station. Drivers on routes through the tunnel had to have at least two years experience on other services to be considered for these routes. The services continued to change for many years, especially when the tram lines over Blackfriars bridge opened on 14 September 1909."

The effort also looks to better understand the threats bats face from climate change. Bats also face threats from habitat loss. And from wind energy development. The bat monitoring program has acoustic surveys. The surveys find the high pitched frequencies given off by the flying mammals as they catch bugs and find their way in the dark. The monitoring program has been driven by a disease called white nose syndrome. The disease has killed millions of bats. And the disease is spreading. Less than a handful of bat species are well understood.

A silkworm builds a case called a cocoon around itself for protection while it changes into a moth. It makes the cocoon with silk that comes out of a tube in its head. The silkworm wraps a single long strand of silk around itself over and over again. Some spiders also make silk. They weave silk webs to catch insects to eat. However, the silk made by spiders is too thin for making cloth. In the silk industry, silkworms are raised from the time they are eggs until they have made a cocoon. In nature, a silkworm breaks open its cocoon to come out as a moth. Silkworms used for industry are killed with hot air or steam inside the cocoon. This way the cocoon is not damaged."

People learned to grind up pods from mesquite trees and make small cakes to eat. Branches and twigs became the walls and roofs of open, airy homes. During the hottest season, the Timbisha moved into the mountains. There, the climate was cooler. The rest of the year, though, they lived in the valley.

However, despite generally needing to do an X-ray test to determine whether a given pearl was cultivated or grown naturally, natural pearls tend to have microscopic cores so only show concentric growth rings at the center vs cultivated ones that show a solid core, natural pearls are usually far more expensive simply because they are more rare, particularly the spherical variety so sought after for making jewelry."

The chain runs around two separate toothed wheels, which act as pulleys. One is attached to the axle of the rear wheel. The other is attached to the pedals through an axle. The pedals work like the crank of a wheel and axle machine. The force used to turn the pedals becomes a stronger turning force on the axle and its toothed wheel. The chain transfers the force to the rear wheel and makes it turn. In some bicycles the chain can be shifted between toothed wheels of different sizes.

The cheetah can keep up the chase for only a short time before tiring. When the cheetah does catch its prey, it trips the animal and bites into it. About three months after mating, a female cheetah gives birth to two to eight cubs. Cheetah cubs stay with their mother for more than a year while they learn to hunt. Some cheetahs in zoos have reached the age of nineteen, but most do not live that long."

You have probably heard this old saying. It isn't just folk wisdom, however. It's chemistry. Another common expression like water off of a duck's back illustrates the same basic principle. The oil on a duck's feathers repels water and prevents the bird from getting soaked in the rain. Naturally oily feathers also help keep a bird dry as it swims. Chemistry is just one way to repel water in nature. Structure, or the shape of things, is another. To excel at water repellency, the lotus leaf relies on both. Unlike water lilies, the lotus holds its leaves and flowers high above a pond's surface. Still, each lotus is amply prepared to fend off a drenching. The waxy surface of the leaves helps repel water chemically."

Or, if they are heavy enough, they can fall to the ground. As they fall they can clump together with other ice crystals to form snowflakes. One snowflake can contain as many as one hundred ice crystals. But some single ice crystals fall as snow, too. The way that ice crystals join together gives every snowflake a unique design. Even so, most snowflakes have six points or six sides. They form seven basic shapes stars, needles, dendrites, plates, columns, columns capped with plates, and irregular. What shape a snowflake takes depends on the temperature and the amount of moisture in the cloud."

When thirty minutes can mean the difference between life and death for a skier lost on a snowy mountain, most people would bank on the dog. The fastest thing is a dog. Faster than a beacon or echo. Speed is crucial in avalanche rescues. Chances of survival are minimal if victims are buried for thirty minutes or more. Wylee is eight. But he's fit. And he's lean.

Don't sleep on your back. Use pillows to elevate your head and shoulders. Sleeping on your back can sometimes cause your tongue to block an air passage. Some people have found that aromatic oils from plants and herbs such as nutmeg, lavender and orange can reduce the more severe effects of sleep apnea. Try placing aromatherapy oils on the nightstand next to your bed. Apnea is the Greek word for without breath.

This will of course help you to lose weight and the more you ride your bike the more weight you will lose. When you ride your bike on flat ground at a slower speed you are still burning a great amount of calories due to the fact that you will be able to continue that pedaling motion for a longer period of time. This is also perfect for people who don't have the stamina for a highly intensive ride at different speeds and climbs.

Acid rain is a type of acid deposition, which can appear in many forms. Wet deposition is rain that has become more acidic than normal. Dry deposition is another form of acid deposition, and this is when gases and dust particles become acidic. Both wet and dry deposition can be carried by the wind, sometimes for very long distances. Acid deposition in wet and dry forms falls on buildings, cars and trees and can make lakes acidic. Acid deposition in dry form can be inhaled by people and can cause health problems in some people. Acidic and basic are two ways that we describe chemical compounds. A substance that is neither basic nor acidic is called neutral."

Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe light waves. Like waves moving across a pool of water, light waves have peaks and valleys. The distance between two of these peaks is called a wavelength. Sunlight contains light waves with long, medium, and short wavelengths. The color of light depends on its wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength. Violet light has the shortest wavelength."

First, he envisioned bowls that were already perfectly tuned. That way, one would not need to mess with having just the right amount of liquid inside to correct intonation problems. Actually making bowls that were tuned to specific tones turned out to be quite difficult; for every 100 bowls made, only one would be suitable for Franklin's instrument. Second, his bowls would be lined up in close sequence on a spindle that would rotate via a foot pedal; this removed the need to rotate one's own hands, as well as allowed a player access to all notes in easy succession, much like on a piano."

Heat, water, wind, living things, and other natural forces cause weathering. Over many years, weathering can shape rock into unusual formations. Weathering is responsible for many rock arches and hoodoos also called lumpy columns. Weathering also has shaped the slabs of limestone. Weathering is related to erosion, which is the wearing away of rock and earth by natural forces. However, erosion generally means that bits of rock and earth are carried away from their original location. By contrast, weathering leaves the main area of rock in place."

Acids include liquids like vinegar and lemon juice that taste sour. These materials react with bases substances, such as ammonia or baking soda, that feel slippery to form salts.

But maybe the sail helped it cool off in the hot sun near the Equator. Or it may have helped to impress their mates. This was not the only dinosaur with a sail roaming at that time. Ouranosaurus, a big plant eater, had one also."

The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rain conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tire and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle. Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car dirty."

What is the main purpose for my garden? You need to look at all of these factors and weigh them against the available gardening options. You can look at the various types of gardening, and start by marking off the ones you're not interested in. Then you can eliminate those that would be impractical or impossible for you to take on. Then you can look at your remaining options and decide which one you'd prefer to try. Of course, you don't have to be confined to a single choice.

They allow for quick, powerful turns and very tight maneuverability. The thickness of a short board is generally only a few inches, which makes learning on a short board very difficult. The nose and tail of a surfboard vary as well. Pointed noses are more common in short boards as opposed to a more rounded nose, which is common in longer surfboards.

When the sun is low in the sky, those colorful arcs may contain only a fraction of the traditional red to violet hues. Or that's what researchers reported. Rainbows emerge as sunlight bends while passing through water droplets in the air. The water acts like a prism. It bends different parts of the light spectrum or colors by different amounts. This breaks the rainbow's light into bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. What results is a vibrant and colorful arc. But sometimes a rainbow will be short a few hues. At sunset, light has to travel a longer distance through the atmosphere than at other times of the day."

Its loyalty and devotion are legendary, and because of this the dog has been called man's best friend. Class distinctions between people have no part in a dog's life. It can be a faithful companion to either rich or poor. Dogs have been domesticated for most of human history and have thus endeared themselves to many over the years. A dog fits easily into family life. It thrives on praise and affection. When a master tells a dog that it is good, the animal happily wags its tail. But when a master scolds a dog, it skulks away with a sheepish look and with its tail tucked between its legs."

Most of the cells inside of your body do not move. If a cell is hungry or needs to get rid of waste, it can't simply move itself to the part of your body where it needs to go. Instead, your body must bring the food to your cells and take the waste away from them. Using billions of tiny tubes, your body is constantly pumping blood throughout your body. On the way out, your blood is loaded with the things that your body needs, like food, oxygen, and other chemicals. On the way back, your blood is full of things that the cells of your body need to get rid of, like waste."

A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum.

When soda companies add carbon dioxide gas to a soda mixture, the water is very cold so it can hold a lot of gas. They also use pressure to put more gas in the water than it could normally hold at that temperature. But when a soda can warms up a bit or when the can is shaken, that extra gas is really ready to come out. Why does soda bubble so much when you pour it on ice cream to make an ice cream soda? Ice cream may look smooth to you, but if you could see it with a powerful microscope you would see something different. Throughout the ice cream there are very tiny ice crystals. The gas molecules from the soda gather on these tiny crystals and become bubbles of gas."

We all know that exercising isn't exactly the most fun part of a diet program. Exercising can seem like work and it's hard to get motivated enough to start. Dogs are good companions for jogs and long walks. They like to get out and see the world and smell the fresh air.

Nouns represent people, places, things, and ideas. Verbs describe action. Every language has its own rules of grammar as well. These rules control the order of words in a sentence. The order of the words gives the sentence meaning. Not all languages are spoken. In sign language, hand movements stand for letters, words, and sentences.

Golfers routinely blame a missed shot on the fact that they didn't hit the sweet spot. Some use this phrase to mean the sweet spot of a golf club, but others know there's a science involved in hitting the right point on a golf ball, also known as a sweet spot.

One of the most serious is terrorism. Some police officers wear uniforms. Others work in everyday clothing, called plain clothes.

When they breathe in air, the oxygen in the air combines with the elements carbon and hydrogen in the body. This releases energy that the animals use to survive. The animals then breathe out a compound of carbon and oxygen called carbon dioxide. Plants take in that carbon dioxide as part of a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis plants break carbon dioxide back down into carbon and oxygen. They use the carbon and release the oxygen for animals to breathe in again. Many other common natural processes also occur when oxygen reacts with another element or substance. These include rust forming on metal, fire burning, and fruit turning brown."

Most birds build nests on the ground, in trees, or on the sides of cliffs. Bees also build nests. These can be found in trees or in the ground. Beavers build lodges made of tree branches and mud that protect them from the elements and predators. Most animals find shelter in some way or another.

The plants are generally small and de-emphasized but are vital to help in the aesthetics. Because the plants are native to rocky areas, they'll be small and like their soil to be drier than most plants but can't completely be without water. A popular type of rock garden is where bedrock is arranged to imply there was a bedding plane that had shifted or had come up partially above the ground. Plants are arranged in this type of garden to hide joins between stones, whereas in its natural setting it would likely be one continuous piece."

Compound machines can be as small as a mechanical watch or as large as a construction crane. Some, such as a car, contain thousands of parts. In a compound machine, forces and motion are transferred from one part to another. One way this is done is with gears. A gear is typically a circular piece of metal with teeth, or ridges, along its outer edge. The teeth of one gear fit into those of another. When one gear turns, it also turns the other gear. Another way of transferring forces and motion is with a type of pulley that uses a chain or a band of flexible material called a belt."

A higher temperature indicates that atoms and molecules have more energy. They also are moving or vibrating faster. To understand how temperature affects electrical resistance, consider the two types of charged particles inside an atom: negatively charged electrons, whose motion generates current; and positively charged protons, which are eighteen hundred times heavier. Because electrons are much lighter, they don't require as much energy to move. It takes a lot more energy, or heat, to get protons moving.

Finally, the females return from the sea, bringing food they regurgitate to feed the now hatched chicks. The males eagerly leave for their own fishing session at sea. The youngsters stay sheltered in their mother's brood pouch for two months. If a young chick falls out, it can freeze to death in as little as two minutes.

As the water vapor cools, it turns back into water, in the form of droplets. The droplets form around dust and other particles through a process called condensation. Clouds form from large numbers of these droplets. In a cloud, droplets come together with other droplets to form larger drops of water. Eventually, the drops become too heavy to stay in the cloud.

But like all good tenants, they pay rent. The bacteria in our gut help us digest food. They help us make vitamins. Bacteria even help our immune system. That's right. Bacteria in our bodies helps our immune system fight other bacteria. Sometimes invading bacteria get the best of our immune system. And then we get sick. We are not trying to be gross. But we are talking life threatening, never ending diarrhea sick. In cases like this, all your good gut bacteria could be washed out. That is unless they have a place to hunker down.

Thanks to modern technology, the different types of surfboards available today are endless. Even though there are so many surfboards to choose from, the 3 main shapes of surfboards are short boards, long boards, and fun shape boards. The size and shape of a surfboard will make a significant difference in the maneuverability and performance of that particular board. We'll cover each shape in detail, but not to overwhelm you, and suggest which one we feel is best for the beginner. Keep in mind that your priorities for a surfer starting out are to catch a wave as easily as possible and stay up on your board."

Nuclear fission happens when the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more parts. Nuclear fusion happens when two nuclei join to form a single nucleus. The nuclei of certain kinds of atoms can give off nuclear energy without fission or fusion taking place. These atoms are called radioactive. Nuclear fusion happens naturally in stars such as the sun. There atoms are constantly combining and creating nuclear energy. That energy is the source of the heat and light that Earth gets from the sun.

Many allergens hide within the floors and walls of our homes and those that come from the outside will somehow find their way inside. It's almost impossible to avoid all of them. Mild allergy symptoms are itchy, watery eyes, congestion, postnasal drip and even a rash. Rashes are sometimes caused by the person rubbing and scratching the infected area. Mild reactions normally don't spread to other parts of the body and are easy contained. Moderate reactions can include some of the mild symptoms but get more severe and spread to other parts of the body. Itching becomes more intense and you could experience difficulty breathing. Severe symptoms can consist of swelling not only in the affected area but other parts of the body as well."

Some sounds can be pleasant to hear and some not so pleasant. But either way, the louder the sound and the longer you listen to it, the more likely it is to cause damage to your hearing. Each ear is divided into three parts, the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The three parts work together so you can hear sound. Hearing starts at the outer ear, which carries sound from the air through the ear canal to the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates, which causes three bones in the middle ear to move mechanically. The middle ear sends mechanical vibrations to the inner ear where they are picked up by hair cells, which send electrical impulses to the brain."

Not only does this allow for increased accuracy and distance, but it also delivers more impact on contact. A high speed rating is probably the greatest and most desired aspect of a crossbow. For practicing and competition, the high velocity transfers the greatest precision. A high velocity means the arrow will arrive at the target faster. This usually means it will be less hindered by wind resistance and will have a smaller flight descent or arc. There are a wide diversity of crossbow makes, manufacturers, and styles."

You might notice something strange. The ground in front of you is steaming. Plumes of white steam rise from the ground. Iceland is covered with steam vents and hot springs. The steam comes from naturally heated rocks and hot water below earth's surface. The most famous of Iceland's bubbling hot springs is Blue lagoon. It is not far from the country's capital city. You can visit the lagoon and soak in its soothing, milky blue waters. Minerals and white mud in the water make your skin as soft as a newborn baby's skin.

The winner is whoever has the shortest period of time with the fewest penalties. If there's a tie, then the fastest time wins. Time plus faults scoring is determined by speed. The score of the handler and dog in the agility competition is calculated by the actual time on the course plus penalties. So if the time score was 38.27 seconds on the course, but the dog incurred 9 penalties, then the score would be 47.27 seconds. In this case, the winner of the dog agility competition is whichever dog has the lowest score overall."

So its molecules are spread out and can flow freely within a space. But when they get into the ocean, the molecules break apart. Now their parts get together with other molecules in the water to form new molecules. These carbon dioxide molecules can become part of new gases, liquids or solids. It's hard to imagine that such a small molecule as carbon dioxide has the potential to drastically change the ocean. Molecule by molecule, the effect of extra carbon dioxide is harmless.

Scientists describe matter, or everything that can be seen, according to the way it is made. All matter is made up of tiny parts called atoms and molecules. If those parts are arranged in a regular pattern then the object is a crystal. On the outside crystals have a regular pattern of flat surfaces that meet in sharp corners. Most matter that is not alive is made up of crystals. Common substances such as sugar and salt are made of crystals. So are metals such as gold, silver, copper, and iron. Diamonds, emeralds, and other gems are also crystals. Some objects that seem solid are not made of crystals, however. Glass is one such example.

The fine art of knowing when to stop is something that you must practice, erring on the side of caution.

If a garment tears easily, it is not durable. If a cold weather topcoat does not keep its wearer warm, it is not useful. If a piece of clothing is coarse to the touch, it lacks appeal. There are, of course, other factors within these three categories that add to or detract from quality. Clothes should not shrink, fade, or lose their creases easily nor should they be readily combustible. Before materials can be sewed together to form a garment, they must be cut according to a pattern. This is a three part operation. The fabric must first be spread on a table."

If time is not a factor then you can literally let the pile sit there and it will eventually break down. However, if you want your compost a bit faster, there are a few things you can do to help speed things up. Use a yard shredder, chipper or your lawn mower, to break down larger items in very small pieces. The smaller the pieces, the quicker they will break down.

A clear pitch with a gentle vibrato that seems to surround you as the sound bounces off the walls of the room.

These are the promises people make to themselves at the beginning of the year to lose weight, save money, stop smoking, etc. Research shows that around half of all adults make New Year's resolutions but fewer than 10 percent of them keep to these promises. Many people make goals at the beginning of January but have given up by February. The main reason people do not stick to their resolutions is because they are too unrealistic. People think it will be easy to change their behavior, but many resolutions need a lot of willpower and many habits are difficult to change."

Plants are very important to the life of almost every other living thing. Like many other life forms, animals are multicellular. These cells come together, forming tissues, organs and organ systems, that help sustain the life of the animal. From elephants to snails, animals come in many shapes and sizes, and can be found all over the world. Animals cannot make their own food. They must rely on other living things, such as plants, fungi, and other animals to sustain them. Without other food sources, animals could not survive.

It was originally intended as a means of developing the imaginative and artistic powers of young children. It has become a hobby for people of all ages. No art training is required; there is no technique to master. Working with the fingertips and with one or both hands and arms, the artist simply gives free rein to fancy. A kind of spontaneous rhythm develops, gradually achieving abstract form. Finger painting lends itself best to ideas that are abstract, to the decorative, and to the imaginative."

To avoid attacks, they have natural protections. Some caterpillars are colored to blend into their surroundings. Others have showy dots or stripes on their bodies that make them look fierce or very large. A few give off unpleasant smells, and a small number grow poisonous hair. A caterpillar hatches from the egg laid by a female butterfly or moth. It grows quickly and soon becomes too large for its skin. The skin splits and the caterpillar wiggles out. This process, called molting, occurs four or five times before a caterpillar turns into a butterfly or moth. Some caterpillars eat up their old skins."

Animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Green plants take in carbon dioxide through their leaves and release oxygen. All organisms need the nutrients and energy that food gives.

Until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins.

Animals that live in caves have special characteristics to help them survive. Those characteristics are called adaptations.

Blog readers not only look for interesting and informative content, they also want to come to an inviting space to read it. The blog's design needs to be inviting to them and comforting. It's crucial not to have anything that would annoy them to the point of leaving because they can't stand it. Make sure you're not annoying them with colored font that's hard to read or a bunch of graphics that are too distracting. A few animated graphics are fine, but don't have flashing ads and glittering graphics detracting from your blog's message, or your strategically placed advertisements."

These shoes were straight and uniform. Both shoes were identical and no right or left existed. Comfort and flexibility had not been implemented until the first rubber soled sneakers were introduced. The sneakers were made by a process of melding the rubber to the other materials which resulted in a strong bond. The earliest sneakers were sewn together by the hand of a shoemaker. Today, however, more modern equipment and machines exist in factories, allowing mass quantities of shoes to be produced in a minimal amount of time. Labor costs are the most significant factor representing the cost of shoes."

At night they crawl around looking for fish, crabs, and clams. Lobsters also eat plants and dead animals. When a lobster needs to move quickly, it flicks its tail to jet itself backwards. A female lobster lays thousands of eggs at a time. The eggs stay attached to the mother's swimmerets until they hatch several months later. Newly hatched lobsters look like small insects. They float on the water's surface and eat tiny plants and animals. Many of them do not last long because fish and other creatures eat them."

You learn the rules and, if you try hard, you might win the game. Yet, knowing the rules is only the half of the story. What makes poker different is that there is some room for deceiving, though players adapted another term for it, they call it bluffing. Over half of your successful outcome in poker depends on bluffing. It's not only important that you know how to bluff yourself, it's even more important to learn how to see through your opponents. It's really difficult to learn how to bluff. First, it takes time and a lot of practice and second, you should be a little bit of an actor in sense that you should play as if on a stage.

You might charge a flat fee, take a commission based on the number of click throughs, or make a deal where you get a percentage of the sale of a product, much like an affiliate marketer does.

Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 on the trip. The titans finished their first season 7-7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375 fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats."

Avoid storing chocolate in the refrigerator. Milk chocolate will keep this way for about a year. The darker varieties will keep for several years. Care must be taken when melting chocolate or you can easily end up with a grainy mess. The lighter the chocolate, the higher the chances of this happening. The most important thing to remember is that chocolate melts better and faster at lower temperatures. The best method is using a double boiler. If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a heatproof bowl which is large enough to be suspended over a pot without its bottom touching the simmering water. Simmer the water over low heat and stir the chocolate often. Remove from the heat as soon as the chocolate is melted and stir until smooth."

With a long, sticky tongue that darts out and zaps the unsuspecting bug! The frogs eat many kinds of small insects, including fruit flies, ants, and tiny beetles, which are the ones scientists think may be responsible for the frogs' toxicity. Poison dart frogs live in the rain forests of central and south America and breed during the rainy season. To attract a female, the male frog calls from a leaf, making buzzing or trilling sounds. After he's attracted a mate and she lays her eggs, the male sticks around to make sure the eggs stay moist until they hatch. Once the little ones hatch, as tiny tadpoles, they wiggle on to the male's back. He carries them to a pool of water, where the tadpoles wiggle off and complete their metamorphosis into fully formed frogs."

In laser tag, the goal is to hit another person's targets strategically placed on their body with your laser. Most often, guns are used to shoot at someone's vest. When shot in certain places, the shooter will gain points. Occasionally in large games, there are teams. Each team will have a base. When players of opposite teams hit the base with their laser, that team is shut down for a period of time. When the vest is hit, it disables the gun from shooting for a period of time, allowing one to still be shot. The US army was the first to use a series of laser combat training guns."

So if you are just starting to ride bikes for the first time, please don't just jump on the bike and go for a 20 mile ride as it may do you more harm than good. One thing that is recommended is to do short rides to start with, only a couple of miles which will take no time at all on a bike, to get your fitness training up to par before starting a longer bike ride.

Dramas are commonly called plays. Other forms of literature, such as novels and short stories, are meant to be read by individuals. But through staged productions dramas are shared with many people at once. A person called a playwright, or a dramatist, writes the play's text. The major elements of a play, or drama, include the characters and the plot. The characters, or the people in the story, often come into conflict with each other over something. For example, they may desire the same throne, princess, or treasure. The plot is what happens during the play and how the conflicts are settled."

Light travels at different speeds in different substances. It refracts, or bends, as it passes through one substance to another. For example, a ray of light is refracted as it moves from water to air. Therefore a straw standing in water seems broken at the surface where the air and water meet. Mirages and rainbows are also caused by the way light travels. Sounds also travel in ways that affect how they are heard.

The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat building traditions until today.

Matter can exist in three different states. Solid, liquid, or gas. In evaporation, matter changes from a liquid to a gas. In condensation, matter changes from a gas to a liquid. All matter is made of tiny moving particles called molecules. Evaporation and condensation happen when these molecules gain or lose energy in the form of heat. As the sun heats water in a puddle, the puddle slowly shrinks. In a similar way, as water in a pot boils, the level of the water falls. These are two examples of evaporation.

It depends on vines of another type of plant for survival. The flower develops from a seed that falls into cracks in the woody vines. A bud grows inside the vines until it is large enough to break through the vine's bark. The flower then blooms. Its rotten odor attracts flies, which carry the flower's pollen between plants. Animals eat the flower's fruits and spread its seeds. The flower lives for only about a week. The monster flower and other rafflesias are rare. Tourism, farming, and road building have disturbed some of their habitats. At least one type of rafflesia is considered to be endangered, or at risk of dying out."

Many families love to play card games. Others get hours of fun playing classic board games for all the family. One of the best ways to spend a few hours with your family is to play a board game. One of the benefits to board games is that there are games to suit all tastes. The earliest known board games are thousands of years old and were found in the tombs of ancient egyptians. Every society and civilization has a history of board games. In times gone by, boards were made from wood or leather, with the playing guides etched into the surface. These days most boards are rectangular or square in shape and made from modern materials such as plastic."

The entire bag is enclosed in a strong net to which the passenger basket is attached. At the top of the bag is a valve for releasing gas. This is connected to a cord that usually runs through the envelope and out the appendix, hanging within a balloonist's reach. Bags of sand are hung around the basket for ballast.

In some plants, roots suck up water from the ground. In other plants, leaves and stems take in water. On a hot summer day a thirsty birch tree can sop up 80 gallons of water from the ground. That tree can then release almost the same amount into the air as water vapor. In dry places, plants must make every drop count. A desert cactus' leaves store water. Some plants become dormant during extremely dry times. When rain finally falls, they burst back to life in an explosion of color. Plants use water to spread their seeds, too. Rivers and oceans are seed superhighways. The moving water can take plant seeds to far-away places."

The expedition used Lewis' fifty five foot long keelboat and two smaller boats called pirogues to carry their supplies and equipment. The boats used sails to move along, but in going upriver against a strong current, oars and long poles were used to push the boats. Sometimes the boats had to be pulled upriver with ropes by men walking along the shoreline. They averaged ten to fifteen miles per day."

It is no wonder, then, that we find highly developed agriculture systems in some ant species. At the top of farming abilities are the famous leaf cutter ants.

Most snakes live alone for most of the year. Some kinds gather for mating or hibernation. Most snakes lay eggs, but others give birth to live young.

A star's core is very hot. Great pressure squeezes the core, causing some of the hydrogen to change into a gas called helium. This process produces huge amounts of energy and makes the star shine. Stars vary in size, temperature, brightness, and color. A star's temperature, as well as its chemicals, makes it shine in a certain color. The bluer stars are usually hotter, while the redder stars are cooler. The sun is somewhere in between. It gives off yellow light. The sun is a fairly average star in terms of its brightness and size. Stars probably begin as clouds of hydrogen and dust. This material slowly pulls itself together into clumps."

For example, people see the Sun because it gives off its own light. But people see the moon only because it reflects light from the sun. When only the surface of an object can be seen, the object is said to be opaque. Opaque objects do not let light pass through them. Instead they reflect and absorb light. As a result, they are not see through. For example, a mirror is an opaque object that reflects almost all of the light that hits it. Most other opaque objects reflect and absorb some light. Objects made of wood or steel are opaque. A colored object reflects only certain wavelengths of light."

In one process, called strip mining, miners take coal from just below the surface. In deep mining, miners dig long tunnels to get to coal that is buried far underground. Mining coal can be dangerous for the miners. Coal miners can be injured or killed when mine roofs collapse. Gases trapped in coal sometimes cause fires or explosions. Many miners have health problems from breathing in coal dust over the years. Compared to other energy resources, coal is inexpensive and plentiful. However, coal has several disadvantages. Burning coal can create acid rain, a dangerous form of pollution. Burning coal also increases the temperature of Earth's atmosphere, which may be harmful to living things."

Spending some time on a regular basis to gather supplies for maintaining your coin collection should be high on your priority list as a collector. Also a good coin collector should be able to easily detect counterfeit coins. Another thing to bear in mind for collectors is that you should never clean the coins unless absolutely needed.

That kind of speech is called a soliloquy. Occasionally a character will speak directly to the audience. That is called an aside.

Those fears might be dentists or dogs. This kind tends to form in childhood. It will often go away over time. Then there are two more types of phobias. These are more deeply rooted.

Generally, ocean waters are layered, with each layer having a different temperature. The bottom layers of the ocean are considerably colder, near freezing, than the surface layers. Every few years unusually warm currents occur in the south pacific ocean off South America. This rise in temperature is due to a relaxation of the trade winds that move the ocean waters throughout the globe. Without the trade winds, the surface water rate of evaporation declines and heat loss slows. Called El Nino, this periodic increase in temperature fluctuates from a small increase in temperature to a large one. A strong El Nino can influence climates worldwide!}}"

Sometimes the media may show bias. This means that they choose which types of story to cover and which ones they want to exclude. This bias may be political. Some newspapers support one political party, so they prefer news stories that show their party in a better light than the others."

Dry color may be added to increase the whiteness or to impart specific colors.

But as the colonies grew, Americans felt that the British government was treating them unfairly. They felt that they were paying too much in taxes to Britain and thought the colonies should have a say in how things were governed. By June 1776, Americans were tired of trying to work out an agreement with Britain. They were also tired of being told what to do, so they decided to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 8, 1776, the first celebration took place in Philadelphia."

Anything a culture wanted to preserve its beliefs, its history, and its traditions had to be told out loud. Each generation would tell the culture's stories to the next generation. In this way the stories were passed along. Knowledge passed on in this method is called the oral, or spoken, tradition. Even cultures that know how to write still pass along some information in this way. In some cultures everyone would pass along the stories. In other cultures only special storytellers were entrusted with this important job. A culture's best storytellers had good memories. They could also make the tales very entertaining."

What happens in a supply and demand economy if there's little demand for the supply? That's right, the supply drops and prices can tank. Just think of today's housing market to get a picture of less demand creating a decreasing supply. You'll see fewer new homes being built and few homes being sold. If there's more demand than supply, the prices rise. In the world of currency, this hamster wheel of supply and demand is what helps to keep a country's currency stable."

Baby proofing your home is a major concern, and rightfully so. Many accidents that happen in the home can be prevented with a few safety precautions. Before you spend a penny on baby proofing accessories, take an inventory throughout your home to look for trouble spots. Some examples of baby dangers are chemicals, open toilets, bathtub faucets, sharp edges on tables and other furniture, staircases, unprotected electrical outlets, heavy furniture such as bookcases and entertainment centers that could fall on baby, window blind cords, electrical appliances, sharp utensils, doors that lock on the inside, and choking hazards."

It was first tested on the 15th of November, 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal. Towing a train of four sledges, the air tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at Cape Denison. The freezing conditions resulted in the jamming of the engine's pistons after just 10 miles, and the air tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913."

If you ask somebody to say the first word that comes to mind when you mention the word scooter, Razor is most likely to be the one they say. Razor revolutionized the push scooter and gave it more stability and style. They didn't just stick with one version of their widely popular toy; they manufactured them in colors and even created ones that adults can ride. Some Razor scooters have three wheels so once you get going you can ride with both feet on the back and steer around objects with more control. It also helps with balance."

These dogs are very intelligent but they can also be stubborn and light headed. This may lead to a few problems in training. Knowing about their quirks will allow you to train them correctly to make them obedient. Those who have no experience with the breed may get a little frustrated with training these dogs. Often this may lead to yelling or anger which will definitely not help you. If you are having too many problems training then it is best to get help from a professional trainer who has experience working with the breed. Obedience schools for American bulldogs are not only for amateur owners.

To understand just how frogs snatch their snacks, scientists took measurements of the frogs' tongues in action. It was the first time anyone had done that.

They have thick fur and lots of body fat to keep them warm in the harsh Arctic conditions, and have large furry paws that act as snowshoes on land and flippers underwater. To give them better grip on icy surfaces, the pads of a Polar bear's paws are covered in soft little bumps called papillae, which give them better traction like how big treads on snow tires help cars stay on the road in the winter. Their neck and forelimbs are quite long which they use to hunt seals through holes in the ice. Their powerful hindquarters help them to lift their prey on to dry land."

As it gets closer, the manta starts to roll. It flips over, end over end, amid the plankton. As it spins, the manta uses flaps on the side of its head to scoop plankton and water toward its mouth. The manta then filters the water through its gills. The water gushes out. The plankton stays in. Rays live in many ocean habitats. They swim from the deep ocean to shallow coral reefs.

These include a north south trend of fault scarps up to 20 feet high and pull apart cracks or fissures in the earth. These fissures are not technically faults because little or no vertical or horizontal movement has occurred along them. Most notable among these is earthquake fault, a fissure up to 10 feet wide that cuts 60 to 70 feet into glassy rhyolite lava flows. The fissure was formed by stretching induced by the intrusion of the Inyo Dike. Stairs to the bottom of the fissure were removed after being damaged by earthquakes in 1980."

A large cardboard box will feel lighter than a small box that is actually the same weight. This happens because the mind expects the bigger box to be heavier because of its size. Because it is not heavier, it feels lighter. The eye can also be deceived by contrasts. If a gray patch of paper is placed on a black background, it looks whiter than it did before; if placed on a white background, it looks darker.

But it actually takes earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to complete its orbit, about 365 1\/4 days. Those extra hours gradually add up so that after four years the calendar is out of step by about one day. Adding a day every four years allows the calendar to match up to the solar year again. However, because the solar year isn't exactly 365 days, even adding a leap day every four years means that the calendar is still out of step by 11 minutes and 14 seconds each year.

Wood is very easy to acquire, transport, and work. But it burns easily, can develop mold, and may be eaten by termites. Concrete is made by mixing cement, water, and small pieces of sand and stones.

I will recommend the one I like at the close of this article. A good guide takes you through the steps to learn the very basic techniques which are central to any method of design: strokes. There are different strokes which will create shading and add dimension to your cool drawings. Finding the right guide to walk you through the steps to mastery in a logical progression is very helpful."

They think that riders are putting themselves and other people in danger. Most states do not include bicyclists in cellphone or texting laws. The problem of bicyclists using cellphones and texting is new, so there are not many laws about it."

They work on a task or project or to achieve a goal simply for the love of doing it. Studies have shown that intrinsic is a better motivator than extrinsic but most of us are spoiled to the point of not doing something unless we're rewarded. Motivation is a behavior you can influence to your advantage. But realize that even a highly motivated person can get discouraged or tired of working on a task if he's not noticed and rewarded. People need to know they're appreciated and that their good work does not go unnoticed.

While both a nuisance and threat, this insect is actually a very important piece of the American food chain. Many have been dying as they cannot find food to eat. These creatures live in areas that are being destroyed by humans through construction, agriculture and pollution. The result is that bee colonies are disappearing fast. Some environmentalists and experts say the decline in bees could become a disaster for our food supply. Bees along with birds, bats and butterflies are important parts of our world's food supply. These creatures pollinate many different types of food, including fruit and vegetable crops, alfalfa and clover, nuts, seeds and fruits."

By the time Triassic age rocks developed, all signs of these critters had vanished. What caused the great dying has long been a mystery. Many scientists suspected that a massive volcanic eruption had something to do with it. Occurring in what is a part of Russia now known as Siberia, this eruption lasted millennia. But there was little hard evidence linking that eruption to the extinctions. So the biggest wipe out in the history of life remained a cold case."

The largest branches are civil, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and materials engineering. Civil engineering is one of the oldest fields of engineering. It is concerned with the safe design and construction of structures. Chemical engineers deal with large-scale production of chemicals for industrial use.

The answer could be a few different reasons. Your breath has a lot of carbon dioxide. When you blow, the carbon dioxide pushes oxygen out of the way and the flame goes out. Your breath blows away some of the hot air around the flame. If the liquid wax cools down enough, it can't become a gas. Without wax gas, the flame won't burn. Your breath blows some of the wax gas away. Without this fuel, the flame will go out. Why does a flame have different colors? The colors of a flame are caused by bits of wax molecules that didn't get completely reacted. These glow a certain color when they get to be a certain temperature. Since different parts of the flame have different temperatures, these bits of wax molecules make those areas of the flame glow with different colors."

Light travels at different speeds in different substances. It refracts, or bends, as it passes through one substance to another. For example, a ray of light is refracted as it moves from water to air. Therefore a straw standing in water seems broken at the surface where the air and water meet. Mirages and rainbows are also caused by the way light travels. Sounds also travel in ways that affect how they are heard. The siren on an ambulance has a different pitch when it is moving away from an observer than it does when it is moving toward the observer. Some illusions are caused by the way the brain works."

An airplane creates its own wind by its speed through the air. On a calm day running with a kite in an open space produces the same effect. The kite rises because currents of air, moving parallel to the ground, strike the face of the kite and force it backward. The best wind for kite flying is a steady breeze with a speed of about eight to twenty miles per hour. Less wind makes it difficult to get the kite up. Stronger winds may drive the kite to the ground before it has a chance to rise to a safe height. The line, or string, holds the kite steady, with the face of the kite tipped forward, and the wind pushes up on the tipped face to lift the kite, much as a wedge pushed under an object lifts it."

At the beginning of the cycle, sunlight heats up water on Earth's surface. The heat causes the water to evaporate, or to turn into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the air. As the water vapor cools, it turns back into water, in the form of droplets. The droplets form around dust and other particles through a process called condensation. Clouds form from large numbers of these droplets. In a cloud, droplets come together with other droplets to form larger drops of water. Eventually, the drops become too heavy to stay in the cloud.

Garden plants grow well in soil that is not watered too much. They thrive in sunny areas and will be damaged by frost. Geranium flowers may be round, ragged, or frilled. The flowers occur in clusters and come in shades of pink, deep red, violet, and white. Many of these plants have been developed for their pleasant fragrances. When their leaves are rubbed, they may smell like mint, fruit, flowers, spice, or even chocolate. The leaves tend to be thick, though the leaf shapes vary."

It's a good idea to make sure that you get all your running equipment together the night before, having to search around for a missing glove will eat up precious time. If plan on eating before you go out then make sure you eat something that's quick to prepare or prepare something the night before. The clock is still ticking so get yourself out of the house and to your start point as soon as possible.

These planets orbit stars that lie tens or even hundreds of light years from Earth. These discoveries are important, but no single planet is likely to be much of a big deal. The new planet is a very different story. It does not circle a distant star. Instead, it is part of our own solar system, a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now. Evidently not. In a new study shows scientists found strong evidence of a very large undiscovered planet. They say the new planet is orbiting in the solar system's outer darkness beyond Pluto."

If a gecko loses its grip and falls, the tail can help it land safely. The gecko twists, rotating its body and feet downward into a landing position. Then the gecko spreads its legs and glides, using its tail to steer. If a predator tries to take a bite out of a gecko's tail, the gecko simply releases its tail. The predator may have a mouthful of tail, but the gecko is safe. Losing its tail is tough on a gecko. Because its tail plays a key role in balance, a gecko has a hard time climbing and gliding without it. The good news is a new tail grows back in a few months. The bad news is the new tail is not as long or as strong as the old one."

A good player can serve the ball to any spot on the service court. A ball can also be made to bounce in different ways when it hits the ground. This is done by turning the racket in the hand and putting spin on the ball when it is struck by the racket. A perfect serve is called an ace. This happens when a serve is so well placed or is hit so hard that it is impossible for the receiver to return the ball. A let is a serve that strikes the top of the net before landing in the proper service court. Because the normal flight of the ball has been interrupted, the receiver has virtually no chance to get to the ball."

There are always other things you could be doing. Some say there's no cure for procrastination so perhaps we need to seek not to prevent it but to slow it in the best way possible. Procrastinators are late for appointments and have difficulty estimating the amount of time it takes to arrive at a destination or completing a task. They even resort to tricking their mind by setting their clock or watch a few minutes ahead. If you think you're a chronic procrastinator admit to your problem and make a decision to overcome it. Time management can help. Stop giving in to activities that waste time. Develop a routine and break down your daily activities into small steps and tasks.

They've also found ways to send multiple streams, for instance by using light beams of different colors. But in the near future, even those fixes won't keep up with the growing data demands of users. A physicist at Boston University, helped design a new cable. He and his coworkers developed a way to keep multiple beams of light from mixing in a single fiber. They built a 1.1 kilometer fiber treated with chemicals that change the speed of individual light beams passing through."

Throughout the year, the sea ice will change in shape and extent in response to the seasons, causing the seals to move around the Arctic Circle. Polar bears will try to move with their prey as best they can, however, during the summer when the ice melts they either have to retreat northwards on the ice to colder climates or move inland until the next freeze-up, depending on the location of the population. Since they depend so much on the sea for their survival, Polar bears are considered to be marine mammals even though they live on land for part of the year when the sea ice is not available."

Women do this more often than men. Scientists from Italy made this claim recently in a science magazine. They did tests to find out if people can catch the urge to yawn. A yawn is involuntary. A person does not mean to do it. It happens by opening the mouth, breathing in, expanding a tube that leads to the eardrums, and then exhaling. The whole event takes about six seconds. Catching yawns is an example of a social contagion. A social contagion is when information, ideas or behaviors are spread from person to person. It spreads almost like a cold does. A person who sees a friend yawn might also yawn, even if he or she is not tired. A person may also yawn if they hear, see, read about, or even think about yawning."

China did the same thing a few years ago. One of its missiles crashed into a large weather satellite. The missile and satellite shattered into many pieces, becoming the single worst case of space littering, ever."

A bicycle basically consists of two wheels housed in a frame that includes a steering mechanism, a seat, and two pedals. The feet turn the pedals, which are attached to cranks and a chainwheel. A loop of chain connects the chainwheel to a sprocket on the rear wheel, so when the pedals are turned, the wheels move. Throughout the world, bicycles are essential to moving people and goods in areas where there are few automobiles. Globally, there are twice as many bicycles as automobiles, and they outsell automobiles three to one."

Decorative motifs for these sandstone mortar constructions, both cliff dwellings and non, included T shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, such as Stephen Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chaco Canyon elite system, which had seemingly collapsed around a century before. Other researchers see these motifs as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system."

As it turns out, the Empire totally overlooked another design. It would have been faster, cheaper and more effective. It could have simply built the Death Star around an asteroid.

Permission to build the subway was not given until 1906, and they were still not allowed to build the tram line over the bridge. The tunnel would also only be able to have single deck trams in it. This was because of a sewer at the northern end of the tunnel and the district railway at the southern end. When the trams left the subway at the southern end they could turn right along the Embankment to Westminster bridge or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the hop exchange. This latter service was short lived and the tracks were removed in 1930."

Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time, and were highly valued possessions. They were often owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by the King in times of conflict, in order to build a powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were troop transports, not warships.

The technological advancements have made it very easy for you to search for a used car suiting your budget and requirement. The main reason for why used cars are better is affordability. Buying a brand new car is more expensive than buying a used one. The tax procurement and registration fees required for used cars are less than those procured on the brand new cars. Moreover, the initial costs on a new car are hefty. Financial institutions generally require the customers to make down a payment on a new car loan. If you make a lower down payment, then you will be stuck paying higher monthly installments."

Snow leopards show several adaptations for living in a cold mountainous environment. Their bodies are stocky, their fur is thick, and their ears are small and rounded, all of which help to minimize heat loss. Their paws are wide, which distributes their weight better for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase their grip on steep and unstable surfaces. Snow leopards' tails are long and flexible, helping them to maintain their balance in the rocky terrain they inhabit. Their tails are also very thick due to storage of fats and are very thickly covered with fur which allows them to be used like a blanket to protect their faces when asleep."

The process begins when some foreign body, such as sand, a parasite or some other organic material, manages to make its way inside the oyster's shell and comes in contact with the mantle, a layer that protects the oyster's internal organs, sometimes even damaging it. The oyster's body sees the invading substance as a potential threat, and in response the mantle begins to deposit a substance called nacre, also called mother of pearl, onto it. This is the same substance that coats the inner part of the shell. External damage to the shell itself that results in damage to the mantle will also trigger the same type of response to repair the damage."

In one process, called strip mining, miners take coal from just below the surface. In deep mining, miners dig long tunnels to get to coal that is buried far underground. Mining coal can be dangerous for the miners. Coal miners can be injured or killed when mine roofs collapse. Gases trapped in coal sometimes cause fires or explosions. Many miners have health problems from breathing in coal dust over the years."

Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma ray burst progenitors. It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma ray burst. The massive star model probably does not explain all types of gamma ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short duration gamma ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and where no massive stars are present, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos."

A leaf sprouts from each joint. Except for corn, sorghum, and a few others, grasses have hollow stems. The stems of many grasses grow close to the ground, so mainly the leaves are visible. In tropical regions grass leaves are broad. Desert grasses have spiky leaves that help keep moisture inside. The leaves of some water grasses are waxy. The waxiness protects them from the water. Grasses depend on the wind to scatter their pollen and seeds. Some grass seeds will sprout quickly if they land in the soil. Others need to freeze before sprouting. Grasses may also spread through special underground stems. The stems grow in a horizontal direction, and new sprouts grow up from the stems."

Adding good quality compost to your soil helps with drainage, nutrients in the soil and so many other things. Along with the soil benefits you can also take a lot of organic material that would otherwise find its way into a landfill and actually put it to good use. Organic material can be grass clippings, leaves, your leftover dinner, coffee grinds, banana peels and so on. Plastic, Styrofoam and meat bones are not considered organic material for the compost pile. Set aside an area of your yard where you will dump all of these items.

A female cuckoo lays her eggs in the nests of these other birds. When the eggs hatch, the other birds care for the young cuckoos. Plants can use mimicry, too.

She may have to travel over 621 miles to get there. Using her senses and strong flippers, she finds her way to Tortuguero. There, she finds a mate.

Bright arches of hot glowing gas erupt from the surface of the sun. With the unaided eye, the sun looks quiet and calm. You can see something completely different through a telescope. It is dynamic. Gases boil and pop. Fiery storms rage across its super-hot surface. One kind of storm, called sunspots, looks like dark blotches. A sunspot looks dark because it is cooler than the areas around it. At times, many sunspots speckle the sun. At other times, there are few or no spots. The number of spots follows an 11 year cycle."

Authorities are again considering making 55 mph required on all highways in an effort to mandate fuel conservation. If they do that, you'll be well ahead of the game. On some highways in west Texas you can legally drive 80 mph. Gas mileage drops dramatically at this speed. Don't drive erratically. Strive for smooth starts and stops. Pick a lane and stay in it without weaving in and out of traffic. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line."

Row houses, outhouses and evidence of Native American sites were discovered. Before cities collected trash, things that were not wanted were tossed into the outhouse. Today, the discovery of those spots can reveal generations of cultural change. Archaeology in cities is a relatively new field of study. It is the result of new laws and regulations. These new rules establish responsibilities for federal agencies that use federal money to do construction.

They can plan what kind of ring they want and even get a custom design. They can also research the average prices for the kind of ring they want so they can prepare ahead of time.

This motion pushes the ray forward. It also lets the ray hover over prey. A ray uses its fins and tail together to help it move through the ocean. During a fight, a tail can also be a weapon. In a fight, the stingray cracks its tail like a whip. It stings its attacker. A ray has to be careful. It doesn't have a hard shell to protect itself. It doesn't even have bones. Instead, it has a skeleton made of cartilage. Cartilage is tough and it stretches a little. Still, it's not as strong as bone."

It is made up of long threads, or fibers. Skeletal muscle controls movement, posture, and balance. A person can move skeletal muscle just by thinking about it and then doing it. Cordlike structures called tendons connect skeletal muscle to the skeleton. As skeletal muscle tightens, or contracts, it gets shorter. It pulls on the bones attached to it. As the muscle relaxes, it gets longer. It lets the bones fall back into place. In this way skeletal muscle makes the bones move the parts of the body. To make skeletal muscle move, the brain sends a message along a type of nerve called a motor nerve. Motor nerves end in the fibers of the muscle."

How long a star lives depends on how big it is. The largest and hottest stars have the shortest lives. These stars live for only a few million years. Smaller stars tend to live longer because they don't use up their fuel as fast. Our sun is about halfway through its life. We expect it to burn for another five billion years. A star's size also affects how it dies. When a star the size of our sun runs out of fuel, it puffs out its outer layers of gas. It slowly dims. Some of the largest stars collapse on themselves when they run out of fuel. The outer layer of a large star explodes into space. The star's outer layers form a kind of nebula around the dying star."

You may have also found yourself in a zoned out state where you're so focused on one thing that you have no idea someone is talking to you at that moment.

Nowadays, many car dealers are keeping their attention on offering great deals on used cars. It is important to decide how much you are willing to spend for a used car. This can help to narrow down your search. Once you have decided the car dealer and the make or model according to your requirements, you can check the car personally during a test drive.

When a volcano erupts, hot gases and melted rock from deep within the Earth find their way up to the surface. This material may flow slowly out of a fissure, or crack, in the ground, or it may explode suddenly into the air. Volcanic eruptions may be very destructive. But they also create new landforms. There are more than fifteen hundred potentially active volcanoes in the world today. Strong volcanic eruptions throw bits of magma into the air. These bits cool into tiny pieces of rock, called volcanic dust or volcanic ash. Wind can carry volcanic dust thousands of miles away. Volcanic ash can coat the land for miles around the volcano."

Only a small portion of thunderstorms produce tornadoes, though. Sometimes a single thunderstorm produces a series of tornadoes, called tornado families. The appearance of several tornadoes over a broad region is called a tornado outbreak. Water droplets in the air make the whirling winds of a tornado visible. The visible column is called a funnel cloud. A funnel cloud may be shaped like a cone, pillar, or tube. It can range from a few feet to hundreds of feet wide. Once a tornado touches the ground, it travels across land at about twenty eight miles per hour. Tornadoes usually move from west to east."

This yellow, bonelike material is softer than enamel. Dentin makes up the largest part of the tooth. The center of a tooth is called the pulp. The pulp is soft tissue that contains blood and nerves. Nerves in the teeth send signals to the brain about heat, cold, or pain. The soft tissue around the base of each tooth is called the gum. The roots of the teeth lie below the gums. A tooth has between one and three roots. A gluelike substance called cementum coats the roots. Cementum keeps the teeth stuck in the jawbone."

Most herbs are very hardy, and they don't require a lot of ongoing maintenance. If you choose mainly perennial herbs, you will have herbs that come back year after year with very little additional work. As long as you keep them watered and weeded, they should keep growing relatively well without a lot of additional work.

This is due to the fact that we can use our senses to feel these forces. We can, for example, quickly determine the approximate temperature outside simply by stepping outside. We immediately know whether it is cold, warm or hot. Likewise, we can feel the amount of wind, or see the level of windiness by looking at how forcefully the trees are swaying back and forth. Even humidity is easily perceived. This is not the case with pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force or pressure exerted by the atmosphere on the objects located within it. The more pressure there is, the stronger that force will be, or the harder the atmosphere will push against animals, plants, rocks, and the surface of the earth."

The part that's getting hurt is known as the anterior cruciate ligament. This is not a bone, but a ligament something a bit like a rubber band. It helps hold the bones of your leg together. If the ligament is stretched too far or torn, serious problems result. It turns out that girls are more likely than boys to suffer this injury. The new study compared girls and boys playing the same sport. It found that girls are two to six times more likely to hurt their knees than boys.

A simple search on the internet will also reveal scientific studies as well as informative articles about alternative health care.

To defeat your opponent, usually the victor needs to collect more points or gain a winning position on the board. How long it takes to learn a new board game will vary according to the particular game and person.

One of the main problems with the barter system is a business may find another business offering what they want, but the feeling is not mutual. The transaction will never happen without a facilitator. Most barter networks have something called trade dollars, and this is what helps them become the facilitator. So if a business charges $50 per hour for their time and barters 10 hours services, they are gifted 500 in trade dollars. They then use those trade dollars to purchase goods or services in the barter network that they require.

Two sorts of dance evolved as cultures developed, social dances on occasions that celebrated births, commemorated deaths, and marked special events in between and magical or religious dances to ask the gods to end a famine, to provide rain, or to cure the sick. The medicine men of primitive cultures, whose powers to ask the assistance of a god were feared and respected, are considered by many to be the first composers of formal dances."

Some call it a gentle form of dodgeball played with one foam ball. Players do not need to be strong athletes to do well. The game is played inside a hexagonal or octagonal pit with walls only about thirty inches high. The surface must be flat. The number of players does not matter. Everybody starts with one hand touching a wall. The ball is then dropped in the center. Players slap the ball and try to hit the other players below the knee to get them out. The last player left in the pit wins. Players cannot hold or throw the ball, and if someone hits the ball out of the pit, it has to touch another player first. Otherwise, they are out.

The reaction may be wild and crazy or totally oblivious in that classic who cares manner that cats do so well. Inside catnip is a chemical element called nepetalactone, which seems to prompt amazing reactions that are different for each cat. While you can't smell it, catnip has a unique scent to a feline.

The fibers of this muscle form a structure like a net. The fibers form the chambers, or hollow areas, of the heart. As the cardiac muscle contracts and relaxes, blood moves in and out of the chambers. Cardiac muscle is involuntary muscle, which means that it moves automatically. A person does not have to think about telling the heart to beat. The cardiac muscle does not have nerves to tell it to move, either. A special strip of cardiac muscle releases bursts of electricity that help the heart to beat in a regular rhythm. Some of the energy also goes into the body as heat. This means that muscle movement helps to keep the body at the right temperature."

What allows it to stick to any surface, even glass? The answer is in its toes. A gecko's toes are wide and flat. Each toe pad is covered with thousands of tiny hairs called setae. Each hair splits apart into even smaller hairs at the tip. These tips can stick to surfaces. To get unstuck, a gecko peels its toes off of the surface, starting with the tip of its toe. A gecko's toe joints can bend in the opposite direction of our fingers and toes. All of this sticking and unsticking happens very fast. A gecko running up a wall might attach and detach its toes 30 times per second."

This is usually one of the more common signs of transmission failure. You will know if there is a slippage problem if you try to accelerate from a stopped position. Vehicles with normal functioning transmissions allow for a smooth acceleration without hesitation, however a vehicle that may be experiencing a transmission problem would slow down this acceleration process and at the same time your vehicle's RPM spikes up. A jerking motion when putting the vehicle in gear or accelerating from a stand still would be a sign of gear slippage as well. Bad transmissions can also cause vehicles to surge or lurch ahead when driving at steady speeds. You might hear the RPM's have a sudden increase as well."

Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model, the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets, are the same."

Skeletal muscles are usually attached to bones. They are often called striated muscles because of their striated, or striped appearance. The cells of skeletal muscles can be very long, sometimes over 30 cm, and can contain many different nuclei. Your brain usually tells your skeletal muscles what to do. Skeletal muscles are mainly used in movement, such as when you wiggle your toes, wave your hand, and smile. Your body contains many muscles which are not under the control of your brain, but rather operate on their own without instructions."

Magma released from a volcano is known as lava. It glows red as it flows out of the volcano's opening. As it cools, it hardens into rock. Strong volcanic eruptions throw bits of magma into the air. These bits cool into tiny pieces of rock, called volcanic dust or volcanic ash. Wind can carry volcanic dust thousands of miles away. Volcanic ash can coat the land for miles around the volcano. Steam and poisonous gases also escape from volcanoes. Sometimes these gases are mixed with ash and other hot debris.

Like with the other important decisions in life, planning is very vital before you head out and buy your RV. The first thing to consider is the purpose of your RV. Are you planning to buy a motorhome that you can use for your annual family trip? In such case, renting one would be more advisable. Whether you will use it often or seldom, the maintenance and storage costs are given and these are extra burdens on your finances. There are also some people that intend to buy RVs to be used as their permanent residence. In this case, it is more like buying a new home. If you don't need to move in right away, experts advise that you try and rent one or two first. RVs may be very comfortable to live in but can be quite sore if you're in the wrong one."

They might eat a poisonous berry, fall off a tree or let their prey slip away. By watching other members of their species fail, an animal can avoid making the same mistakes. This may improve its chance of survival. Scientists suspected that one part of the brain, the medial frontal cortex, helps animals process information about others' errors. Cells in that region appear to become more active when a person blunders or sees someone else making a mistake. But researchers didn't know whether individual cells in this part of the brain play different roles in detecting errors."

The part that's getting hurt is known as the anterior cruciate ligament. This is not a bone, but a ligament something a bit like a rubber band. It helps hold the bones of your leg together. If the it is stretched too far or torn, serious problems result. It turns out that girls are more likely than boys to suffer this injury. The new study compared girls and boys playing the same sport. It found that girls are two to six times more likely to hurt their knees than boys. Seven out of ten injuries happen without kids even touching another player."

Make sure you play video games. New research shows that certain video games can help people find things better and faster. For instance, if a doctor is looking for something on an xray, or if a scientist is looking at a satellite image, they may be able to do it better if they've trained by playing video games. Certain video games, like driving games, can improve a person's visual search skills. That's the ability to see something that's hidden in the middle of a confusing field of things. Like finding Waldo."

In addition, there has been no association with supernovae. The true nature of these objects, or even whether the current classification scheme is accurate, remains unknown, although the leading hypothesis is that they originate from the mergers of binary neutron stars. A small fraction of short gamma ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies. Gamma ray bursts are very bright as observed from earth despite their typically immense distances."

There are two types of crayon: the coloring crayon and the chalk crayon. The coloring crayon, or wax crayon, is the one used by children in making pictures. It consists of waxes such as paraffin, beeswax, and carnauba wax and dry color. Some synthetic waxlike materials are also used in the modern crayon. The waxes are melted and the dry color added with continuous mixing until thoroughly dispersed. Normally, the crayon is entirely consumed during the marking process through abrasion."

Releasing built up tension is the ultimate reason people run. You can help yourself relax and stay in the rhythm you are creating by keeping your shoulders loose and low. Many people think running is a lower body sport. However, including your arms is an absolute must in keeping a proper running form. Your hands should be unclenched and relaxed with your arms moving forward and backward along to your stride. Try not to move your arms across your body as this will hinder your posture."
